# Customer-DataDive

This Data Dive divides a customer's profile into 4 income ranges.
For the 5 ranges, a Regression Decision tree is used to see what traits of a customer are more prevalent among one income range than another.
A second decision tree is built for only the 5 types of purchases customers make at the store to see which income range is buying the most porducts

A more in-depth presentation of findings is on DataDive4.pptx
